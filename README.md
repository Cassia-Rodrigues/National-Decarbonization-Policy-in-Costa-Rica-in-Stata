# National-Decarbonization-Policy-in-Costa-Rica-in-Stata
This research delves into an examination of the efficacy of Costa Rica's climate mitigation endeavors, with a specific focus on the National Decarbonization Plan instated in 2019. The primary objective is to investigate the potential causal relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The findings of this analysis aim to contribute valuable insights to facilitate the active engagement of other developing nations in climate negotiations, enhance their access to climate finance, and foster the effective implementation of climate policies, drawing inspiration from the exemplary climate actions undertaken by Costa Rica.
